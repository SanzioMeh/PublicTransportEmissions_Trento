The repository for my project on Public Transport Emission estimation for the municipality of Trento

Through this work we are going to perform some mobility analysis and try to estimate the public transport emissions in the municipality of Trento.

The repository contains the GTFS data we utilized, and was taken from https://dati.trentino.it/dataset/trasporti-pubblici-del-trentino-formato-gtfs

Our emission estimation also utilized the gtfs2emis R package available at https://github.com/ipeaGIT/gtfs2emis

To reproduce our results it is sufficient to install the requirements, for both R and python and run the two notebooks.
